# curso-frontend-developer-javascript-practico
Hi! this is a platzi project!
Here we have learned many things, it is a project that links so far two courses, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The semantics, the styles, and the interaction of all the html files. 
I'm excited to start studying now the new ECMAscript6 implementations. And all that is to come, to keep contributing to this project, and initialize my own!
